# AI CookBook

The GitHub folder aims to curate and maintain current information available online. When browsing platforms like LinkedIn, numerous resources and vast amounts of information are accessible. The goal is to streamline and comprehend both AI and Gen AI.

AI vs. Generative AI (GenAI)
AI (Artificial Intelligence)
Example: Voice Assistants

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is commonly seen in voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant. These systems can understand voice commands, perform internet searches, set reminders, and answer questions based on predefined algorithms. They excel in specific tasks but are limited to the functions they are programmed for.

Generative AI (GenAI)
Example: Human-like Cognitive Abilities

Gen AI, also known as AGI (Artificial Generative Intelligence), represents a more advanced form of AI. Unlike AI used in voice assistants, which is designed for specific tasks, Generative AI would possess human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of activities. For example, it could not only recognize speech and answer questions but also learn new languages, understand complex emotions, and adapt to novel situationsâ€”much like a human brain.

In essence, while AI focuses on specialized tasks such as voice recognition and natural language processing, Generative AI aims to achieve broader, more adaptable intelligence akin to human cognition.
